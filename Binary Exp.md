##heap 0
this challenge was fine ig..now the addresses to the data were given..i started by inputting random data in option 2 but that was not working..so i decided to
enter a large data..such that its memory exceeded the safe_var memory...after doing that i got the flag when i chose option 4..so for me it was trial and hit
thing that worked..i am yet to find out the actual way to do this..



##PIE TIME
this one i am yet to figure out the method..how i did it was modify the given address a bit for offset..and i got the flag on my first try..so i was just lucky on this one..
