##IntroToBurp
Used BurpSuite for this challenge as the name suggested. Started running the website on Burp Chrome. Registration page was not causing any issue. The next page was for authentication via OTP
which was giving Invalid OTP result. Noticed the Burp Suite workspace and went to the dashboard, the page where we entered the otp. On copying that Request part and sending it to the Repeater
I checked the response for other inputs. But got the same result as Invalid OTP. 
The request used the POST method, which is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. Now POST sends the data in the body of the request, which in this case is the otp. If we remove
the otp input from the request and try to generate the response, it reveals the flag.

##Power Cookies
This was an easy challenge after the hint was given. at first there were no cookies generated by the website. but on clicking continue as guest button, a cookie was generated. we can find
the cookies under the Application tb in Developer Tools. so a cookie named isAdmin is seen now with value being 0(false). on changing this value to 1(true), we are seen as admin by the website
and thus the flag is generated.
