##Scan Surprise
this one was fine..just received a qr and had to scan it and got the flag
worked on it using the WEBSHELL

this was honestly the hardest one i solved yet..
or if not the hardest..truly time consuming..
first i read the file provided on WEBSHELL using "wget" command
then extracted the text in that file using command: "strings myNetworkTraffic.pcap"
received a bunch of words there..now sth was similar about 6 strings which had double equal to at the end..so i chose them..and decoded them using base 64 decoder..
each of them gave me bits and pieces of the flag..
