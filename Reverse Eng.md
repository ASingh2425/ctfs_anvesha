This one was easy..the flag was given in the code itself..

##Shop
This one was mind binding honestly..
we had just 40 coins and need 100 for getting the flag...so to find a way to get more coinsss by buying stuff???
then i figured out somehow i can even buy stuff in negative quantity..lol i can sell items..
so it was easy then..i sold items..increased my number of coins to more than 100 and then bought the flag..
WORKED ON THIS THROUGH WEBSHELL OF PICO



NO I DON'T UNDERSTAND REVERSE ENGINEERING
